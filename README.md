QChem is a project used for Quantum Chemistry Simulations and Data Anaylsis + Visualization, developed at the University of Waterloo.

Usage:

To use the package at the moment, you need to install Poetry and then install the dependencies contained in the pushed lock file. This ensures consistency among users. Ideally work should be done in Jupyter Notebooks or Python Scripts within the notebooks folder. This will allow you to import qchem off the bat, allowing access to tools (e.g., "from tools import utils"). They will remain untracked by Git. 

Development:

Work on seperate branches for changes and submit PR's to main; squash commits when appropriate to do so.
